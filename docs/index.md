# Naay

Naay — "Naay ain't all yaml" — The intent of this project is to define a tiny strict YAML subset where **all values are strings**, plus support for `|` block literals,
anchors, merges, and YAML-compatible single-line comments — implemented with a Rust core and a Python binding. This documentation site is built with MkDocs + Material and uses mkdocstrings to render API docs from the Python package.

- Repository: https://github.com/rbroderi/naay
- Python package (for API docs): naay

See the API docs for auto-generated Python docstrings.
